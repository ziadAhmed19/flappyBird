## FlappyBird
I made this game by Lua programming using LOVE2D frameWork
in which it developed an understadable enviroment to make 
simple 2D games for beginners.
  
## Setup
In order to run the code "Play" you have to download The 
LOVE2D frameWork first from the link down below,
https://love2d.org
after installing you can download "love-launcher" by jan werder
on Vscode and then 
1.Press Ctrl+P and type ext install love-launcher with a trailing space.
2.Press Enter and restart VSCode.
3.Configure your Path to your Löve executable
4.Open your Löve Project in your workspace
5.Press ALT+L to launch Löve.
## Where Did I Learn This?
I took a few lecture of CS50g For game Development a great
